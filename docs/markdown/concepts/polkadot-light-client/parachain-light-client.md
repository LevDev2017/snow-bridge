# Light Client For Snowbridge Parachain

In-Progress
{: .label .label-yellow }

The parachain light client receives our latest parachain block headers from the MMR Light Client. With them, it can extract our parachain commitments.

We can use these commitments to verify and process every message that has been committed to by the bridge.

More details coming soon...
